        <h4>Basic Requirement 1</h4>
        <p>I downloaded two sets of data from the CSO public dataset. I converted them into csv files on my computer, then
           I created two empty dictionaries. My algorithm checks each entry of the csv file, and if it was valid it would be
           added to the corresponding dictionary. If the value was invalid, it was not added to the dictionary.
        </p>
        <h4>Basic Requirement 2</h4>
        <p>I used matplotlib to create three different graphs. The first two graphs display the Average Housing Price and GNP,
            by using the values from the dictionaries I had made. I used AI to help me make the third graph, which uses the data 
            of the GNP, and uses it to update the price of the average housing analytically. Each graph has clear titles, axis labels, and legends.
            One graph is a line plot and the other is a bar chart so that there is different types of visualisations.
        </p>
        <h4>Basic Requirement 3</h4>
        <p>My interactive.html and mortgageAdvice.html combine to make an interactive information system. The user can click a button, and
           see the two graphs of average housing price and GNP. The user can input their custom data into the system, and is provided information
           that revolves around the data from the dataset.
        </p>
        <h4>Advanced Requirement 1</h4>
        <p>When the user loads the graph files, matplotlib allows the user to interact withg the graphs, by hovering over to see data,
           zoom in to parts of the graph, and move the graph around. These graphs are displayed on the interactive page.
        </p>
        <h4>Advanced Requirement 2</h4>
        <p>There are mutiple forms that the user fills out in the interactive webpage, such as income, budget, etc. There are many different 
           types of data collected through these forms. There are text inputs, integer inputs, checkbox inputs, and radio inputs. The data that the user
           enters is then stored in a flask database. When the user submits the form, they are taken to a second page, which eloquently displays the
           data that the user entered on the first file. There is a button on this second file which the user can press to go to the database and view past 
           submissions. 
        </p>
        <h4>Advanced Requirement 3</h4>
        <p>As well as summarising the data that the user entered, the second file of my interactive webpage shows the user whether or not a mortgage
            based on the details that they entered would be viable or not. This page also gives the user recommendations about how to lower their 
            monthly payment, for example, by recommending cheaper locations based on the data from the CSO dataset.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Investigation</u></h2>
        <p>When I saw the requirements laid out in the brief, I immediately thought of the data surrounding housing due to the current housing crisis. 
           I have always had an interest in housing since I was very young, which further encouraged me to use this as my project. As well as this, I see this as a practically
           useful project, which is something I would rather spend my time making compared to something irrelevant. My objective was to make a project where I could estimate the prices of houses in the 
           future based on past trends in the housing market, as well as potentially the wider economy. I researched many datasets, before deciding upon the cso dataset, as I knew it was a reliable source, 
           and that it had numerous datasets that related to my project. I also researched mortgage rates and websites to see what potential mortgage prices could be in the future. I found that mortgage rates are constantly fluctuating
           and depend on a wide variety of factors. For simplicity, as well as to limit the amount of information I needed from the user, I decided to keep a constant percentage rate for the mortgage.  
           I also researched existing interactive mortgage calculators to help me visualise what my project could be like for example the Bank
           of Ireland Mortgage Calculator and AIB Mortgage Calculator, as well as others. I found that a lot of these websites had
           a lot of useless graphics and variables, so I made sure that my interactive page only included relevant details for the user.
           I researched further to see when a mortgage will be accepted, and when a bank will refuse to give a mortgage, so that I could fit this to my model. Different banks had different processes
           in regards to accepting mortgages, but I came to a rough conclusion that a bank will reject the mortgage if the monthly payment would take up more
           than 50% of a person's monthly net income. I originally planned to allow the user to enter details about the house they wanted, however the cso only had general housing data rather than specific 
           detailed pricing, so I kept it to only average housing price.

    </section>

    <section id="section3">
        <h2><u>Plan and Design</u></h2>
        <p>To start my project, I decided to convert the data from my datasets into dictionaries in python. I did this, as it was easier to clean
            the data and use it when it was in the form of a dictionary. I proceeded to graph both average housing prices and GNP over time. This helps to display the data that
            was contained in the dataset in an easy and quick way to understand for the user. As well as this, the graphs show that there is a direct 
            positive correlation between average housing price and GNP. Because of this correlation, I used AI to help me code a graph that would
            update the data of average housing prices to the year 2024 based on the GNP, as my average housing price dataset only went up to 2016. 
            I didn't end up using it in other parts of my project, as it wasn't 100% accurate based on past trends, but I think its interesting to analyse the two variables together,
            which could potentially be used to help to estimate future housing prices. All of this combines to meet the first two basic requirements of the brief.
            My interactive webpage allows the user to enter their details into forms. When the user submits the form, their details are sent and saved in a 
            database that is stored locally on their device. This is beneficial to my project as it allows the user to go back and view their past entries, and see
            which set of details works best for them. When the user submits the form, they are redirected to a new page where their information
            is displayed, as well as potential mortgage details and advice based on the data that they entered. My interactive webpage fulfill all of the 
            advanced requirements of the brief, as well as the third basic requirement. Below you can see two different flowcharts, which each
            model the two main parts of my project. The flowchart on the left gives a breakdown of the algorithm of my interactive webpage. It shows how 
            different variables entered by the user are used within my code, and how I calculated further variables based on them. On the right is a simple,
            but effective flowchart of how I dealt with the public datasets by cleaning and converting the data into dictionaries, and then graphing the dictionaries.

        <h2><u>Create</u></h2>
        <h5>Week 1/2:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Researched topics for my project, and decided upon doing housing prices across Ireland. I researched multiple
                datasets that would work for my project, and decided upon using the CSO dataset, as I could get data on average housing
                prices, as well as national GNP over the same time frame, so I could compare them to each other.
            </li>
            <li>I also downloaded the data from the dataset into a csv file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Week 3/4:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I created all the base files inside of my main folder, so that I had the layout of my project complete.</li>
            <li>I created python code to clean the data on the csv file, convert it to a dictionary, and graph the information, so that it
                could be analysed easier. </li>
            <li>I installed multiple python extensions to use within my code</li>
            <li>I set up the base heading on my index.html file. As well as this, I coded some of the css for the file, including changing the 
                background colour and adding a sidebar so that each individual heading could be easily accessed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Week 5/6:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Started coding my interactive webpage. I made my interactive.html and mortgageAdvice.html files, and made it so that basic inputs
                from the first file were displayed on my second file.
            </li>
            <li>Calculated the average rate of housing inflation by finding the slope of my average housing prices graph, and sending it to the slopes.json file</li>
            <li>Made it so that the user can enter what year they would like to buy the house, and adjust the prices to find what the average house would 
                cost in the year that they would want to buy it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Week 7/8:</h5>

            <li>Fixed errors that had come up in both of the interactive files</li>
            <li>Coded the css for my interactive files</li>
            <li>Created the list that gives advice to users based on the information they input</li>
            <li>Used flask to create a database to store information the user enters</li>
            <li>Updated the interactive file to send the information to the database</li>
            <li>Allowed user to enter their maximum budget to see whether their monthly payment would be too expensive</li>
            <li>I brought in a formula that displays whether or not the bank would actually accept the mortgage or deny it</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Week 9/10:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Added HTML code to the flask python code, so that the data was stored in a more aesthetic way </li>
            <li>Fixed errors within the interactive.html file</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Week 11/12:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Created pseudocode to represent the algorithm of my interactive webpage</li>
            <li>Created a flowchart to help display the steps of my interactive webpage</li>
            <li>Made it so the graphs of average housing price and GNP are displayed at the bottom of the interactive webpage</li>
            <li>Added GIFs to my mortgage advice file</li>
            <li>Changed CSS of my report file</li>

        <h4>Problem I encountered and how I overcame it:</h4>
            <p>One of the main problems I faced during this project was working with the flask database. I had never worked using 
            flask before, so I struggled to create a working database on my first few attempts. I overcame this problem by watching
            multiple flask tutorials online. I also followed the geeks for geeks tutorial on flask, which helped me better understand the 
            syntax, and allowed me to successfully link the database to my interactive file. Furthermore, I was able to add html to my code
            so that the data contained within the database could be displayed in an organised and user friendly way. I spent so much time 
            working on the database that I believe it is now one of the stronger parts of my project.
            </p>

        <h4>How the algorithm works:</h4>
        <p>Firstly, my algorithm takes in the latest values of housing prices from the csv file. It also takes the slope of each of the locations in my graph of the housing prices,
            which I used to be the average inflation per year for each location. The user enters information on the interactive webpage. They enter personal details such as name, income, where they would like there house to be, etc.
           The data is saved to a database, as well as to localStorage, where it is transferred to another file. In the second file, the data that the user entered 
           is analysed and used to calculate new variables. Constants such as housing prices, inflation, and annual interest rates were researched online and are used
           in this file to help with calculations. Depending on when they want to buy, and where they want to buy, the user is shown what the average housing price is 
           likely to be. As well as this, they are shown what their mortgage could look like based on their sample down payment and mortgage length. The algorithm also 
           compares the price of the location that the user chose against the prices of other locations, and if the user is willing to be flexible on their location, suggests
           cheaper areas to the user.
        </p>

        <h4>Pseudocode:</h4>
        <p>My pseudocode displays how my flask database and interactive information system work together. As you can see from the image on the top right,
            a table is created for my database, and is filled with values from the interactive system. My first interactive file is a simple file which is centred
            around the user entering their information into forms. The second interactive file is a bit more advanced, where I used the information that the user
            entered to calculate other variables. All the user information is then displayed, as well as new variables and advice for the user.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Evaluation</u></h2>
        <p>Overall I am happy with my project. I feel my project successfully embodies the true intentions of the brief; extracting data from public datasets and using that data analytically to help people using my webpage.
            My project satisfies all the basic and advanced requirements of the brief. My project successfully extracts, cleans, and stores data 
            from the cso datasets of housing prices and GNP over time. This data is then graphed in a bar chart using matplotlib, which helps the user understand the hosuing market is almost always getting more
            expensive, which helps them understand the sooner they buy a house, the cheaper it will be. My interactive webpage contains forms 
            for the user to enter information, which is sent and stored within a database. I was successfully able 
            to analyse the data that the user entered into the form, and return valuable pieces of information and advice to the user.
            If I had to improve one thing, it would be to add in some sort of AI tool that could predict the housing prices in the future in a more accurate way than just a linear inflation.
            This would decrease the percentage error of my algorithm, and allow users to better analyse their data using my webpage. Another small thing I would improve would be to 
            host my database on a remote server rather than on a local database. This would allow the user to access their information from any device, and have more security over the information
            that they enter. If I were to redo this project now, I believe I would be able to produce a much higher quality product due to the skills I have developed while doing this project.
